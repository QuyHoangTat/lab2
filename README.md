# CI/CD Microservices Pipeline Using Jenkins and Docker

## Project Description

I built a CI/CD pipeline for microservices using Jenkins and Docker, separating the app into frontend and backend services. This project helped me improve my skills in Git, GitHub, Jenkins, and Docker by integrating continuous testing, versioning, and deployment.

## Outcome

I successfully:

- Initialized the Git and GitHub repo.
- Created a CI/CD pipeline with Jenkins.
- Dockerized microservices for deployment.
- Linked GitHub with Jenkins for automation.
- Developed a basic understanding of creating APIs and connecting them with the frontend.
- Gained confidence in DevOps practices.

This project equipped me with essential skills and experience that will be valuable for real-world DevOps and software development environments.

### Workflow

1. Set up Git and GitHub.
2. Build the frontend with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
3. Create a Node.js API that returns JSON and connect it with the frontend.
4. Containerize the application using Docker.
5. Test locally: access the frontend via `localhost` and the API via `localhost:3000/data`.
6. Automate the entire process using Jenkins.

    ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cb674546-3314-4f3f-a912-86d76054b2f1)

  - Set up Jenkins on Docker to automate the build, test, and deployment processes.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/96a035e6-7677-4427-8c8b-4f55fc45abdd)

- **Jenkinsfile Automate Process**
  - Created a Jenkinsfile to define the pipeline stages: Checkout, Build, Test, and Deploy.
  - Integrated Jenkins with GitHub to trigger builds on code commits.
 
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e4ac58d1-e364-4570-91f4-e2ea225d386a)

- **Docker Integration**
  - Dockerized both frontend and backend services for consistent environments across development and testing.
  - Used Docker Compose to manage multi-container applications.
**The encountered problems and their potential solutions are discussed in the end.**
## 6. Testing and Validation

For automated testing of the backend microservice, I used Pythonâ€™s `unittest` module. This module provides a framework for writing and running tests, which helps ensure that the backend code functions correctly.

- **Basic Example of `unittest` in Python**

Here's how I used `unittest` to test the backend microservice:

Code is available in the Backend folder with the name `test_backend.py`.

## 7. Deployment

### Dockerized Microservices on Windows - Manual Deployment of Docker container

1. **Build Docker Images**:
    - Created Docker images for the frontend and backend using the Dockerfile in their respective directories.
    ```bash
    cd frontend
    docker build -t frontend:latest .
    ```
    ```bash
    cd ../backend
    docker build -t backend:latest .
    ```

2. **Run Docker Containers**:
    - Launched the frontend and backend containers in detached mode, mapping appropriate ports to the host.
    ```bash
    docker run -d -p 80:80 frontend:latest
    ```
    ```bash
    docker run -d -p 3000:3000 backend:latest
    ```

3. **Verify Running Containers**:
    - Verified that both containers were running by listing active containers and using dockers desktop.
    ```bash
    docker ps
    ```
